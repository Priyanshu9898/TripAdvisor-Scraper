But to my surprise the ambience, hospitality and enthu driven team from Marriott turned the day upside down.  The team is AMAZING Upon knowing I had a long day, they upgraded the room, invited me to a Ghazal event that happens daily (4 months in an year), and a superlative cold coffee really made me forget everything and I truly, honestly enjoyed the stay.  The property is amazing, located right besides Tapi river where sun sets in a spectacular way. The SPICE TERRACE offers a scenic view, and leaves you mesmerized.

Rizwan at check inn was great - perfect hospitality but everything else was just poor ! It’s NOT a NEW hotel it’s the OLD beaten down Taj Gateway retrofitted very poorly . The lobby has been upgraded and it ends there. The restrooms and facilities in the lobby haven’t been upgraded .. see pics - the room says the same story.. new furniture in parts. Washrooms dressed with new accessories but no upgrade on the bathroom fittings - a shoddy poor attempt at re-clothing an aged beaten up property.

It is unfortunate that in spite of our best intentions we were not able to provide your with a seamless experience. I have taken a note of your feedback and observations about the property. With regards to the laundry delivery we did have instruction on the laundry form filled to have the same delivered at 7 am hence our associate called your room as the room was on DND.

,,,01Birdlover,4.0,"Looks can be deceiving - you must try this hotel, best hotel in Surat","From first glances the exterior of the hotel is dated (including hallways on guest levels) and in need of refurbishment, but don't let this put you off. The hotel is currently undergoing refurbishment. Hence some of the rooms have been recently renovated with modern decor, including a comfortable bed, 2 seater lounge/sofa, nice black wooden floors, desk and good size bathroom with glass window. I was fortunate to stay in one of the newly renovated rooms. It looks as if 50% of the rooms, the ones on the city view side (not river view) have been done up on level 5 and have a control panel by the bedside and also at the front door to press for laundry, do not disturb or cleaning which is helpful.   Rooms are a great! Service is excellent and prompt (especially in room services -…",,January 2010,

,,,chimey,2.0,Unfortunately the only hotel in Surat.,"As me and my wife really had to be in Surat, we booked the only 5* hotel in town. The hotel is the previous Holiday Inn, they have made some renovations, as the lobby which is nicely done.  Some of the rooms have been renovated recently, but missed a charm. They started well by getting a cosy (fake)wooden floor, but then didn't finish it properly. No carpet next to the bed. The halls are also quit dirty. Isolation is zero, you are abble to hear the flush of the toilet of the neighbours up, under and next to you.  Food; As Surat is mainly Jain, I would't recommend you to order meat, I orderd some rice with chicken and it was really bad. But the pizza is fresh made and the taste is excellent!",,December 2009,
,,,Lucozade_Warrior,4.0,"Great lobby/public areas, old rooms","Without a doubt one of the best places to stay in Surat. The public areas such as the lobby, restaurants etc are top grade and plush which increased my expectation from the rooms. However the rooms and the hallways turned out to be old & tired in urgent need of a refurbishment and some modernization.   I would also advice any traveller to Surat not be put off from the hotel by my description, i would doubt that there is a better hotel in Surat.   The breakfast spread was quite good and the food at the restaurant is good. This is one of the few places in Surat that serves non vegetarian food and if you have a craving for italian and continental food while in Surat, there is no better place.",,November 2009,
,,,AbhishekG,4.0,Good Budget Hotel,stayed here for two days for a business trip. Located on teh banks of River Tapi - the hote lis far from the busniess district of surat and is located in a posh residential area. considering surat as a city is not that big - the distance from the business district is a non issue.  Hi speed internet and wifi in the hotel is pretty good compared to otehr hotels in bigger cities and the hotel does not charge a bomb for availing it.   food was average except for the innovative live counter for Indian Phulkas which is a definite plus - doesnt let u miss home. For authentic gujrati fare - would advise u to venture out to a thali place called sasuji closeby.

,,,Maxxuk,4.0,Value for Money,"I happen to stay in Hotel Gateway on a Business trip.   Rooms are quiet  and the Hotel itself is located very close to Tapi River.  You can get good South Indian food at nominal price ( as compared to other Taj Hotels).   Ask for weekend rates, if you happen to stay during weekends and you might get a better deal.  On the whole, I felt its value for money for less than 4K INR ( less than USD $90) during this trip.  For the record, prohibition is in force in Gujarat; imbibing liquor in this state, where Mahatma Gandhi was born 132 years ago, is against the law except under special circumstances.  If you are foreigner, you will have an added advantage of getting the liquor from this hotel ground floor as the Government authorised shop functions from this hotel!",,June 2009,

On several occasions that I have stayed in the hotel, I had to request for a change of the room. The gymnasium is ok, there is also a pool, which I haven't used.

This shocked & impressed me! We took the Triple Share option, But I don't think that the Taj Gateway should offer this. The room was small & honestly couldn't accommodate 3 people comfortably. It is ideal for 2people. The problem when we stayed & probably still now is the construction going on. We would hear knocking & banging noises coming from our floor @ 11pm.
